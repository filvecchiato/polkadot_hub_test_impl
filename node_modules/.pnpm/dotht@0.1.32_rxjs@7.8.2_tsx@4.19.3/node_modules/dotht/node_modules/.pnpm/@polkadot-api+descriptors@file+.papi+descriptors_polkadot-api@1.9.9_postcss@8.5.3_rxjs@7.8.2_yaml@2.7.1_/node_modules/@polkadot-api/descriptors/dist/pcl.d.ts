         *  parachain across a bridge to another ecosystem destination.

         *  fee on the `dest` (and possibly reserve) chains.

         *- `custom_xcm_on_dest`: The XCM to be executed on `dest` chain as the last step of the

         *- `weight_limit`: The remote-side weight limit, if any, for the XCM fee purchase.
